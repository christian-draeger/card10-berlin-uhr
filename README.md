# Berlin-Uhr
## The Berlin Clock

This project is a simulation of the so called ["Berlin-Uhr"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin-Uhr) that can be displayed on the the [Card10 Badge](https://card10.badge.events.ccc.de/).

The clock, which was included in the Guinness Book of Records and has a total height of seven metres - including the mast - was erected on 17 June 1975, initially on the central strip of the Kurf√ºrstendamm at the corner of Uhlandstrasse as the **"first clock in the world to display time with luminous coloured fields"**.
As a tribute to its inventor Dieter Binninger, it will be brought back to life on card10.
